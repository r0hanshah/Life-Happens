Run the backend server and frontend application as per the documentation.


# Installation

To set up the Life Happens application on your local machine, you'll need to install the dependencies for both the frontend and the backend. Below are step-by-step instructions to get you up and running.

## Frontend Installation

1. Open your terminal and change the directory to the frontend folder of the cloned repository:

    ```
    cd /path/to/Life-Happens/frontend
    ```

2. Run the following command to install all the necessary frontend dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Once the installation is complete, you can start the frontend server with:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

    This command will launch the Life Happens application in your default web browser.

## Backend Installation

1. Now, open a new terminal window or tab and navigate to the backend directory:

    ```
    cd /path/to/Life-Happens/backend
    ```

2. Create a Python virtual environment in the backend directory:

    ```
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    On Windows, you might need to use `python3` or the specific path to the Python executable.

3. Activate the virtual environment. The command depends on your operating system:

    - On macOS and Linux:

    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    - On Windows:

    ```
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. With the virtual environment activated, install the backend dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```



5. Before running the server, set up the required environment variables:

    - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

    ```plaintext
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

    Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with the API key you obtained from the OpenAI website.

    - Obtain the `serviceAccountKey.json` file for your Firebase project and place it in the `backend` directory.


6. Finally, start the backend server. You can use Flask's command or directly run the app:

    - Using Flask's command:

    ```
    flask run
    ```

    - Running the script directly:

    ```
    python app.py
    ```

    Make sure the `FLASK_APP` environment variable is set if you use `flask run`.

You should now have both the frontend and backend servers running. The backend API will be available for the frontend to make requests to, and you can begin using the Life Happens application to manage tasks effectively.
